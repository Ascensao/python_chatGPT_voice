# Python chatGPT Voice Assistant

The chatGPT Voice Assistant is a Python-based AI assistant that is capable of transcribing voice commands into text, generating responses based on your input, and speaking back to you in Friday's AI of Iron Man movies style. The script uses the OpenAI chatGPT Turbo API for generating responses and the Pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech conversion.
